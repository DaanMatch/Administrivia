```{admonition} Slack Etiquette ðŸ’¬
:class: tip
1. **Check Slack daily.** Slack will be our main media for communications.
2. **Default to public channels.** DMs are private. So if someone asks you a question over one, others on your team may do the same later on without knowing you already answered it.
3. **Use Slack Threads for Conversations.**
4. **Make messsages skim friendly.** Use emojis and bullets to help people understand and better navigate your message.
5. **Mind the channel's purpose.**
6. **Use @mentions mindfully.** 
```
