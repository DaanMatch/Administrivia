:::{admonition} What is AWS RDS?
:class: tip, dropdown
[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks, such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

:::{admonition} What is MySQL?
:class: tip, dropdown
[MySQL](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-mysql/) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL). A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or a place to hold the vast amounts of information in a corporate network.
